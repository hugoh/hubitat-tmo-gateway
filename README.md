# Hubitat T-Mobile Internet Gateway Driver

This is a driver for the T-Mobile Internet gateway for Hubitat.

It is a port of the excellent [tmo-monitor by highvolt-dev](https://github.com/highvolt-dev/tmo-monitor).

I've also adapted and simplified [syepes' deploy script](https://github.com/syepes/Hubitat/) to streamline the development flow. See `deploy.py`.

Currently, only the reboot functionally for the Nokia gateway is available. If more is needed, please feel free to log an issue or, even better, a pull request.

This is my first Hubitat driver and my first Groovy project, so any feedback is welcome.
